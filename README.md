LITERATURE SURVEY
Natural disasters cause great extents of damage and multiple deaths. A 2007 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that coastal flooding alone does some $3 trillion in damage worldwide.
India receives a high average rainfall for a country of its size. Sometimes, up to 15 cm rainfall may hit a place in a single day. The average number of lives lost has increased from 33,771 from 1950s-1960s to 48,707 in 2011-2016.

THE WORST IMPACTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS
These events bring with them a host of issues, including humanitarian, public health, environmental and infrastructural problems.
The main impacts are:
> Loss of life
> Economy and livelihood- floods destroy the basic livelihood of people such as farms, livestock, small businesses
> Health issues-  floods record severe fatalities, injuries and expose many vulnerable to diseases and infections including           military fever, pneumonic plague, dermatopathia and dysentery
> Property- floods erode houses and infrastructure and a lot of debris is left behind


POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
A. Loss of Life

PHASE 1: Locating stranded people with the help of drones

Cell phone networks are at best spotty, and at worst completely out of reach during natural calamities, with jammed lines and poor connectivity. It will be very difficult for those in peril to get access to help, especially those stranded in remote areas. In the event of a flood, there must be systems/mechanisms in place to alert first responders to people stranded and/or in need of rescue. Thermal imaging is a technology that enables detection of people and objects in total darkness and in very diverse weather conditions. An optimal solution would be to make use of drones with IR sensors mounted on them. These drones would be deployed over affected areas to survey them and pick IR radiation coming from living beings. It will also help in identifying areas with large density of people needing help. The data collected is sent to a base station and shared with first responders already in nearby areas or on their way to help.

PHASE 2: Relocating people to safe zones

1. Detect highest density population area  
This includes two stages:
- Before Flooding- Signals sent by people present in safe zones or in high altitude places can be accumulated to generate a heat map based on population density of a certain place and the nearest safe location can be sent to victims that are stranded. This can also be verified with a learning model with a database containing data about areas on high altitudes, optimum precipitation water vapour content, wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure.
- After Flooding- Using the same idea, heat maps are used to scope out affected areas with high population density and send that information to rescue operations


2. Navigation system
Drones that drop off inflatable boats with basic essentials in areas where victims are stranded. The main problem is people are unaware of where and how to go to safe zones. This can be solved by building a navigation system which provides a safe and reliable route to the nearest safe zone.              


B. Property Loss
1. Property papers and other essential bonds are safeguarded on a decentralised incorruptible network storage.
2. Job insurance is offered to people in disaster prone areas which provides financial aid and job search services. Insurance companies may be more inclined towards providing these services due to the infrequency of such events.
